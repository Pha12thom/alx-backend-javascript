Certainly! Here's a sample README.md for your JavaScript components:

# JavaScript Components

This repository contains a set of JavaScript components written in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). Each component serves a specific purpose and demonstrates the use of key features introduced in ES6.

## Components

### `taskFirst`

The `taskFirst` function initializes a variable using `const` to express a preference for constant values when possible.

```javascript
export function taskFirst() {
  const task = 'I prefer const when I can.';
  return task;
}
```

### `getLast`

The `getLast` function returns a string indicating that something is okay.

```javascript
export function getLast() {
  return ' is okay';
}
```

### `taskNext`

The `taskNext` function uses `let` for variable instantiation as it involves reassignment. It combines a string with the result of `getLast`.

```javascript
export function taskNext() {
  let combination = 'But sometimes let';
  combination += getLast();

  return combination;
}
```

## Usage

To use these components, you can import them into your JavaScript project as follows:

```javascript
import { taskFirst, getLast, taskNext } from './path/to/components';

// Example usage
console.log(taskFirst());  // Output: 'I prefer const when I can.'
console.log(taskNext());   // Output: 'But sometimes let is okay'
```

Make sure to adjust the import path based on the structure of your project.
